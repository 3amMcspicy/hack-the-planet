## Programming and Data Science for Biologists

Welcome to the landing page for EEEB G4050, Programming and Data Science for 
Biologists. This site will serve as a resource for the class, with links to the syllabus, tutorials, videos, readings, and assignments. You can access most of these categories from the navbar at the top, including a link to Canvas, which we will use for grades and for its Discussion feature.

#### Course design
As the name suggests, this class is designed to focus on 
*programming* and *data science skills*. In this way it may be 
quite different from other classes you have taken that introduced
programming languages for domain-specific applications, such as 
statistics or bioinformatics. Here we will focus more generally on 
learning skills that are generally useful for any type of data science.
This includes an improved understanding of your operating system, of 
where software resides, of how it is designed, of how programmers write
software, and of the community and resources that are available to you
to learn programming and data science skills on your own. 
By learning best practices for designing software tools you will 
learn that *a lot* of scientific software is not actually very 
well written or designed. By learning a framework for writing good
software you will find that you can often contribute greatly to the 
community of biologists by developing simple and efficient software tools.


#### Inspiration
The name and design of this site is inspired by the 
[hit 1995 movie *Hackers*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackers_(film)). 
If you have not seen it, I highly recommended it (I think you can find it streaming). Although you will not learn to "hack" in the strict sense
in this class, I do strongly promote the ethos of hacking in the sense
of sitting down and hacking away at a problem until you learn to
solve it. 
Although you can learn a lot through tutorials, much of programming comes down to learning routines and muscle memory by practice. When you get stuck, 
try, try, and try again until you can find a solution that works. And seek
help. Treat this course like a hackathon, meet with your colleagues to 
discuss and work on assignments together, to brainstorm project ideas, 
and to solve hard problems. It should be fun.

Finally, our theme of "hack the planet" borrowed from Hackers 
relates well to a focus of many students in this class, which is 
computational biology. We will learn about finding, parsing, and
analyzing large data sets, such as those used in genomics or 
biodiversity research. Keep this theme in mind as you work through 
the course.

#### Learning objectives
- You will learn to code on *your* computer (mac, windows, linux, etc.)
- You will learn to install, remove, and update scientific software.
- You will learn to use software development tools (text editors, linting, testing).
- You will learn to plan and design a software tool to achieve some goal.
- You will learn to develop, document, and publish a software program.
